# Behavioral Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains my Java assignment project. All source code has been organized and committed to the src folder for easy access and review. Project Structure

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- src/ [ folder_name ] : Contains all Java source files (.java)
- bin/ : (Optional) Compiled output (generated automatically)
- .vscode/ : VS Code configuration (if applicable)

### How to View the Assignment

Clone or download this repository. Navigate to the src directory. Open any .java file to view the implementation.

The project is set up using Visual Studio Code with the Java Extension Pack. No external dependencies are required unless specified in the code.

Feel free to explore, run, or review the code as needed.
